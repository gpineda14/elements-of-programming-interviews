# Recursion #

Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solutions is found using smaller instances of related problems.

Recursion can be useful for searching, enumeration, divide-and-conquer, and decomposing a complex problem.

A recursive function consists of the base case and calls to the same function with different arguments. The base cases are important they determine when the recursive function reaches a solution.


## Tips for dealing with recursion problems ##

1. Recursion is suited when input is expressed using recursive rules
2. Recursion is good for problems involving search, enumeration, and divide-and-conquer
3. Recursion can be used as alternatives to deeply nested iteration loops.
4. You can make a recursive solution nonrecursive by mimicking the call stack with a stack data structure
5. You can also cache results if you know the recursive function may end up calling itself again with the same arguments.
