# Greedy Algorithms and Invariants #

Greedy algorithms compute solutions at a step, checking at each step for a locally optimum solution.

A greedy algorithm does not usually provide an optimal solution, but can in some cases. A problem can have multiple greedy solutions but only some of them are optimal.

## Tips for dealing with greedy algorithms ##

1. Greedy algorithms are usually a good choice for optimization where there is a natural set of choices to select from.
2. It is easier to conceptualize a greedy algorithm recursively and then implement using iteration
3. The correct greedy algorithm is not always obvious.
